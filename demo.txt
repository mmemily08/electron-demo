Electron Demo: Local File Viewer ✅

If you can read this inside the app, the demo worked.

What just happened?
1) Renderer (Chromium) showed the button + UI.
2) Main process opened the native file picker.
3) Node.js read this file from disk.
4) The content was sent back to the renderer via IPC.

Fun fact:
This file lives on my computer (Desktop/Documents), not inside the app.
